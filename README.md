## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xezwjmclbpvklojbcmaj.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here

# Mapbox (get from https://mapbox.com)
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token_here

# Site Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME=Nat Ford Planning & Design
```

See `ENV_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions on getting your Mapbox token.

### 3. Database Setup

The database schema has been created in Supabase with the following tables:
- `tenants` - Organization/client accounts
- `profiles` - User profiles with tenant relationship
- `projects` - Project management
- `files` - File management with versioning
- `messages` - Project messaging
- `approvals` - Approval workflows
- `activity_log` - Audit trail

Row Level Security (RLS) policies are implemented for multi-tenant data isolation.

### 4. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the site.
