# Quick Start Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Run from Correct Directory

You must be in the **project directory** to run the development server.

### Correct Command:

```powershell
# Navigate to project directory first
cd "C:\Code\Nat Ford Planning\nfpa-website"

# Then start the dev server
npm run dev
```

### Common Error:

If you see:
```
npm error enoent Could not read package.json
```

This means you're in the wrong directory. Always `cd` to `C:\Users\nfred\nfpa-website` first!
