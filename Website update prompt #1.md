**Role:** You are the site editor for **Nat Ford Planning & Analysis**. Your job is to refactor, rebrand, and fact-check the entire website so it accurately represents the company’s portfolio (new firm) while preserving prior employment accomplishments in a clearly labeled biography/resumé section.

**Non-negotiables**

* **Attribution wall:** Do **not** list work performed while employed at **Green DOT Transportation Solutions** as Nat Ford Planning & Design portfolio work. Those items belong under **About → Background & Prior Roles** with clear labels like “Role: Senior Transportation Planner, Green DOT (2021–2025)” and “Contributions while at employer.” Keep case-study-style detail, but do not imply these were firm projects of the new company. [Nat Ford Planning & Analysis](https://www.natfordplanning.com/about)

* **Add prior roles:** Include: Transportation Coordinator for **gRide (Genentech’s commuter program)**; Planning Intern at **San Francisco County Transportation Authority**; Legislative Intern for **Supervisor Jane Kim (District 6, SF)**. Summarize responsibilities and notable achievements succinctly in the About/Resumé area.

* **Source of truth:** For education, certifications, affiliations, and long lists of projects/clients, prioritize the attached résumés. When in doubt, prefer facts from those documents, and do not invent details.

   Résumé 2021

**Information architecture (canonical sections & what goes where)**

* **Home:** Short value proposition \+ strongest **current** capabilities/services; “Trusted by” can include agencies you’ve served personally, but mark them “served by Nat in prior roles” if engagement was through a former employer.

* **Services:** Planning; GIS & Spatial Analysis; Aerial Mapping/Photogrammetry (Part 107); Grant & Funding Services; AI-enabled Documentation. (Write crisp 2–3 sentence blurbs each; end with typical deliverables.) [Nat Ford Planning & Analysis](https://www.natfordplanning.com/)

* **Projects / Case Studies (Company Portfolio):** Only projects delivered under **Nat Ford Planning & Design**. If none yet, create “Starter Portfolio” with **method demos**, anonymized templates, and “Representative Work (performed by Nat at prior employers)” as a **separate** clearly labeled subsection—not counted as company portfolio. [Nat Ford Planning & Analysis](https://www.natfordplanning.com/projects)

* **About:** Bio, credentials, awards, affiliations, **Prior Employment Experience** (Green DOT, gRide/Genentech, SFCTA, Office of Jane Kim) with bullet highlights and links. [Nat Ford Planning & Analysis](https://www.natfordplanning.com/about)

* **Resources / Process / FAQ:** Keep; update brand voice and cross-links after the rebrand. [Nat Ford Planning & Analysis](https://www.natfordplanning.com/)

**Style & voice**

* Confident, plain-English, public-sector-friendly. Avoid hype; emphasize **results, funding wins, safety, and implementation**. Keep page intros ≤40 words. Use parallel bulleted lists.

**Concrete edits to make now**

1. **Projects page:** Move any items completed during **Green DOT** employment (e.g., Sierra County RTP; Tehama VMT & CIP; Del Norte ATP; Placer MIAS; El Dorado Next Gen; Plumas Transit FTA 5339\) out of the **company portfolio** grid. Re-present them under **About → Prior Employment** with clear role/attribution, dates, and bullet outcomes. [Nat Ford Planning & Analysis](https://www.natfordplanning.com/projects)

2. **About page:** Keep degrees, certs, and affiliations; add the gRide/Genentech coordinator role and the two San Francisco internships with one-line outcomes each. [Nat Ford Planning & Analysis](https://www.natfordplanning.com/about)

3. **Services:** Retain current four-to-five service buckets, but add **example outputs** per bucket (e.g., RTP chapters, CIP tables, PostGIS schema, orthomosaics/DEMs, benefit-cost worksheets, doc generation pipelines). [Nat Ford Planning & Analysis](https://www.natfordplanning.com/)

4. **Contact CTA:** Keep the 30-minute consultation offer; ensure the CTA button text matches the new brand and appears on Home, Services, and About. [Nat Ford Planning & Analysis](https://www.natfordplanning.com/)

**Data to pull verbatim (for accuracy)**

* Education (SJSU MUP; SFSU BA), certs (FAA Part 107), affiliations (APA; SVS APA roles; YPT), scholarship/awards, and skills/tools (GIS, Adobe, data analysis, public speaking).

   2025 Resume \- Nathaniel Redmond…

**Presentation rules**

* When listing prior-employment projects, prefix the line with **“(Prior role)”** and include the employer name; do not use company portfolio badges on these cards.

* Add a one-sentence **“Attribution Policy”** at the top of Projects: “Company portfolio includes work performed by Nat Ford Planning & Design. Projects completed by Nat in prior roles are clearly labeled and described in the About section.”

**Quality checks before publishing**

* No remaining “Analysis” strings in titles/footers/meta; all say **Planning & Design**. [Nat Ford Planning & Analysis](https://www.natfordplanning.com/)

* No project card implies firm-level delivery where work was performed in prior employment.

* Internal links updated (About ↔ Projects; Services ↔ Projects; Contact CTAs).

* Accessibility pass: headings in order, alt text on hero/logo updated, color contrast unchanged.
