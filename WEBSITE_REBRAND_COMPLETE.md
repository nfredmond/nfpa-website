## Future Work (Not in Scope)

The following items were noted but not required for this rebrand:

1. Individual case study detail pages (already planned, need full content)
2. Individual service detail pages for GIS, Aerial, Grants, AI (directories exist, need pages)
3. Resources/Process/FAQ pages (exist, may need content review later)
4. Client portal and authentication (future phase)
5. Actual company portfolio projects (as Nat Ford Planning & Design completes new work)

---

## Testing Recommendations

Before deployment, perform these checks:

1. **Visual regression:** Compare homepage, about, services, projects on mobile/tablet/desktop
2. **Link validation:** Use automated tool to verify all internal links resolve
3. **Lighthouse audit:** Ensure performance, accessibility, SEO scores maintained
4. **Screen reader test:** Navigate with NVDA or JAWS to verify brand name announcements
5. **Content accuracy:** Final review of education/certification dates against source resume

- **7 projects** properly attributed with employer badges
- **5 service areas** enhanced with detailed deliverables (25+ specific outputs listed)
